# pibble
Rubble interface for the Raspberry Pi (Model 2 for now)

##Hardware
You will need:
-Raspberry Pi Model 2
-MicroSD card w/adapter (if you don't have a microSD card reader)
-Wi-Fi dongle
-Ethernet cable


##Dependencies

Python 3.4

##Wi-Fi setup

There are a ways to setup the Wi-Fi connection on the Raspberry Pi. We will use a headless installation, meaning
there will be no need to hook up the Pi to a monitor over HDMI.
